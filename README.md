This repository contains a Conky configuration file that creates a technical mastery dashboard. It provides real-time system information and stats in a sleek and professional manner. I have done this on my Arch Linux.

- Customized layout and styling for improved readability and visual appeal.

## Usage

1. Ensure Conky is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Copy the `conky.conf` file to your Conky configuration directory (usually `~/.config/conky/`).
4. Restart Conky or reload the configuration to see the changes.

## Configuration
